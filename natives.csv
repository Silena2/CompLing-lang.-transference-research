The film is a documentary, and showcases how factory farming for the sake of feeding our human population places a large negative impact on the physical and psychological well-being of the animals. Through this lens, the film tries to convince its audience that this practice is morally wrong and that they should fight for animal rights and only buy from organic farms, if they dont want to go vegan or vegetarian."

Penny tried to ask for the gentleman frog's given name in her most polite voice, but James reproached Penny for barking and seemed content to spend the evening without even attempting conversation, so Mr. Frog suffered through a most improper silence until James' bedtime.  <br/> It was the middle of the night, and a gentle breeze was wafting through the open window, when Penny heard a soft, reedy voice from the windowsill:  <br/> ""Pardon this unmannerly exit, ma'am,"" whispered Mr. Frog, ""but I really must be getting home to my family."" <br/> Penny nodded briefly, not wanting to wake James, and the gentleman frog disappeared into the night.  <br/> The next morning, James was distraught to find Mr. Frog missing from his glass jar, despite Penny's reassurances that their guest was really all right.  <br/> ""Where did he go?"" cried James. ""What if he is lost in the forest?"" <br/> ""Mr. Frog went home to his family,"" said Penny. <br/> ""Oh, don't bark, Penny,"" said James. ""I know you must be worried, but we'll find him and bring him home."" <br/> ""He's already home,"" said Penny.  <br/> ""Shh, Penny,"" said James.  <br/> Since James could not be convinced of Mr. Frog's safety, Penny's only choice was to accompany her human into the forest in pursuit of their recent guest. Like most humans, James went about making an unbelievable amount of noise, calling for ""Froggy!"" incessantly and stepping on every loud twig that could possibly lie in his path. <br/> ""I rather think 'Froggy' is a disrespectful moniker,"" said Penny. ""Also, oughtn't we check the pond first?"" <br/> ""That's right, girl,"" said James. ""You call for Froggy too! Keep barking!"" <br/> ""What izz your human doing, what izz he looking for?"" asked several bees from a nearby hive. <br/> ""We had a run-in with a gentleman frog last night; I didn't catch his name,"" Penny explained. ""My human seems intent on finding him again, though I'm not sure he knows where to look."" <br/> The commotion brought Tom Weasel wiggling out of his house to laugh uproariously at the sight of James calling into the hollows of Owl Tree. <br/> ""Does your human know ANYTHING about animals?"" said Tom, wheezing with laughter. ""All he's going to get out of that is a very angry Mrs. Owl - she's just gone down for a nap, just watch - "" <br/> Sure enough, Virginia Owl soon appeared in her tree's branches, although James had since moved on to the large rock at the front door of another house. One of Virginia's eyes was still closed, and her beak was downturned in a fantastically sleepy scowl. She took a deep breath.  <br/> ""WHO,"" bellowed Virginia. She paused to yawn. ""WHO dares -"" <br/> ""FROGGY WHERE ARE YOU?"" yelled James.  <br/> Tom snickered so loudly that Penny took it upon herself to forcefully remind him of his manners, and as such, almost missed the sudden hush that swept through the whole clearing. Even James fell silent, which was sufficiently strange for Penny to go immediately running to her human's side, but she found him sprawled helplessly over Sir Roland Buck's wide face and rising steadily as the buck stood up.  <br/> ""Oh, for the love of all good creatures in this forest,"" said Sir Roland in his slow, rumbling way.  <br/> ""Sir, I apologize,"" yelped Penny. ""My human - "" <br/> ""Yes, yes,"" said Sir Roland, while James clung to his antlers, terrified. ""Come along.""  <br/> It turned out that the pond was much closer than Penny remembered from her last trip to the forest, which was comforting. She did think that Sir Roland could have dropped her and James off in a less literal fashion, though."

That night, however, Jerry wanted to go see his family back in the pond. So while Joey slept soundly in his bed, Jerry climbed out of the bowl and quietly hopped back to the pond. However, Jerry did not realize that his exit from the bowl made a splashing sound which woke Joey up. Spots had also heard something akin to steps outside his crate downstairs. Spots ran upstairs to check on Joey and the two were perplexed when they looked at the now empty bowl. The next day, they went outside in search of Jerry. Looking through the nearby park and at the edge of the woods, Joey and Spots called out for Jerry but to no avail. Eventually, Joey crawled over a deer with Spots following close behind him. They were both tossed off the deer's head into a pond. As Joey and  Spots emerged from the water, they climbed over a nearby tree trunk. Joey was sad he could not find his new pet. Once they had dried off, though, Joey looked to the side and saw Jerry with his family. Joey realized that Jerry was better off in the wild living with his family.

He resigns himself to it without protest and lights a cigarette from his tin when he spots a child abandoned in the corner. At first, he glances up, as if to comedically suggest the child was dropped with the trash. Having a conscience but no desire to adopt the child, he attempts to return it to a woman pushing around another infant in a stroller. Unfortunately, she angrily resists this event as the child is not hers. He decides to return the child to the spot where he found it, but a police officer has come up behind him and made it exceedingly awkward to appear to abandon his infant. He ends up passing the kid to a man on the street and running away, but the man somehow manages to deposit the child into the same basket as the woman from before. As Chaplin paces past, she assaults him with an umbrella. To make matters worse for him, the police man returns to the scene, and he is forced to retrieve the displaced infant. Chaplin sits on the edge of the sidewalk, temporarily defeated, and considers dropping the child into the gutter. He shakes his head and checks instead for a note within its blankets that reads, “Please love and care for this orphan child.” An affectionate smile now on his face, Chaplin executes his trademark waddle into the background as the film ends.

After some years, Borden and Angier have both established their own acts, but they also both manage to sabotage the other in some way.  <br/> Borden has a trick he calls 'The Transported Man', and Angier eventually steals the trick by using a double, but being dissatisfied, he sends his assistant Olivia to work for Borden and spy on him. She gives Angier Borden's ciphered diary, but remains with Borden, having fallen in love with him.  <br/> Angier goes to meet Nikola Tesla and ask him to build the machine that the diary says Tesla built for Borden, as the secret for The Transported Man. The end of the diary confesses that Tesla never built a machine for Borden, but Tesla manages to build a replicating machine for Angier anyway, which Angier uses to revamp his magic show with a ""new"" Transported Man that's far more impressive than Borden's original.  <br/> Borden's wife commits suicide, and Olivia leaves him as well, due to his increasingly erratic nature. Borden himself is frustrated by Angier's success and sneaks backstage at one show; to his horror, Angier plunges down through a trapdoor into a waiting water tank and drowns, and Borden is eventually tried and hanged for murdering Angier.  <br/> Right before Borden is hanged, Angier shows up at the prison, alive - he's finally gotten revenge for Julia's death, and he takes away Borden's daughter. Angier's old stage engineer finds out about the replicating machine and realizes that for his Transported Man trick, Angier has been drowning himself over and over and creating clones that appear elsewhere. After Borden dies, a mysterious man shows up and shoots Angier and it turns out to also be Borden, who has actually been twins living as a singular man this whole time."

Most of the students are beautiful and live in a gated community and it seems like her and her two friends are the only ones that don't. She has a crush on this guy named Drew but he is dating this other blonde girl who is the queen of the school. She joins the swim team to try to get his attention as the boys and girls teams practice near each other. While doing so, she hits her head and falls in the pool unconscious. Drew saves her life with CPR and mouth to mouth and she swoons over the situation. The next day the blond girlfriend Lisa comes to the pet store where Mandy works and tries to make her seem embarrassed for working there in front of Drew who she brought along. Mandy thanks Drew for saving her life again and they begin talking and set a time to meet again. They hit things off when they meet in the park but Lisa is furious. All the while, at home, Mandy has an overbearing father who is much too overprotective of his 18 year old daughter. When he finds out that she wasn't where she told him she was going to be after school and was actually with a boy, he's furious and grounds her. Terrible timing because Drew invites her to his big party that night, but she tells him she's going. She tells her dad that she's going to her friends house to study and he allows it but tells her that he will call on her new video phone every half hour. So while Mandy and her friends are out at the mall buying clothes for the party she has to trick her dad into thinking that she's still in the house. While doing all of this Lisa is trying to sabotage her chances and does everything she can think of to stop her from going to the party. Despite all of this she makes it to the party and dances with Drew but goes up to the tower where supposedly he takes a girl every year at this party. Uncomfortable and embarrassed she ends up leaving him in the tower. But later at prom he sees her while he is being crowned prom king and brings her on stage to be his queen and kisses her.

He had gotten behind on paying the rent and needed a good crop to sell to make up the money. However, the father was drunk and instead, purchased a beautiful race horse. Although the mother was extremely upset with the father's stupidity, their son decided to take care of the horse and train it. Not only did he train the horse but he even plowed the field. It was apparent that the boy and the horse had an incredibly special bond. However, the First World War broke out. The father's crop had failed due to bad weather. He knew that the army was looking to buy horses for the British Cavalry, therefore, he took the horse to market and sold it. The first soldier to have Joey (the horse's name) died in the battle. Joey was then taken by the Germans. He would eventually cross over multiple times between the Allied and Axis powers. After numerous death and obstacles, Joey and the boy reunite, both having gathered their strength back from the brutality of war. They all return home.

But what the family is unaware is is that the house they moved into is where the last family was murdered. While unpacking, the father finds a box of old home movies and when he begins to watch the first one, it seems like an innocent family home movie. But the film takes a turn, it shows the families murder. This makes the father a little excited since no one could explain how the family had died or why, but with these films he believes he can begin to create a timeline. Not only does he believe he can help solve this case, but in the box there are more tapes showing other families being murdered in some horrific ways. Throughout his writing process, he stays in contact with a local deputy and continues to ask him questions about the house, and the other murders. The family begins to experience strange things around the house and the mother learns that the horrific murder that she keeps hearing about in town took place in her house. The family moves back to their old house, when the writer receives a phone call from the detective stating that the murders are connected by the houses, and since the writer's family lived in the last murder house, they were now in the connection. This occurs right before the author discovers a set of tape pieces that show who the murderer is, and to his horror, finds out that it is the missing child of the murders that enact the killing. And at this point, he is drugged by his daughter and when he wakes up his wife and son are also tied up and his daughter kills him.

They would sometimes get lost in their imaginary games for hours. One day in the middle of the summer as Eleanor and Buster were looking for dragon eggs in a calm pool on the edge of the river a frog hopped right onto Eleanor's shoulder. Eleanor was enchanted with her new friend, who spoke to her about life as a frog and how he had traveled all the way down the stream to the Big Pond and there were pirates in the big pond. Buster was dubious about trusting the Frog, and he was a little jealous of the interest Eleanor had her new friend. He made it clear that he was not interested in being the Frog's friend. Eleanor invited the Frog up to her house for a sleep over. She prepared his bowl and fed him a big supper. Buster, was still not delighted by the Frog's presence. He did not believe that the Frog had ever been down to the Big Pond or that there were pirates there. Once Eleanor fell alseep the Frog decided to leave. While he enjoyed Eleanor's company, he felt like Buster didn't like him. When Eleanor and Buster woke up and the Frog was gone Eleanor became worried that the Frong was kidnapped. She insisted that Buster come with her to help her find the Frog. Buster was reluctant but goes along to support his best friend. The two went further down the stream than they have ever been. They saw strange new animals, and felt a little afraid when they didn't recognize where they were. The area was all new, but Eleanor insisted that finding the Frog is essential. Eventually Eleanor decided to stop and rest on top of a little ledge. She saw some black berries and went to reach for them, but suddenly she found herself on top of a deer. The deer was so startled that he flicked his head and she went flying into a body of water. Buster jumped in right after her. When they resurfaced they realized that they must be in the Big Pond. The Frog noticed the disruption from the other side of the pond and swam over immediately to investigate and help out. The three realized what had happened and were simultaneously irritated and touched. The Frog apologized for being rude and not leaving a note and lying about the pirates. He said that he would be lucky to have Eleanor and Buster as his friends. Buster apologized for not being nice to the Frog. Eleanor forgave Buster for being grumpy, and the Frog for exaggerating the truth.

It's big eyes bulged and a low sound reverberated deeply in it's belly every so often. With a smile, Tommy dubbed the frog Samuel. Since Tommy had quite a long day, it was time for him to go to bed. He said goodnight to Samuel in his glass jar, and tucked himself into bed. Early the next morning, little Tommy awoke to find Samuel's jar was empty. His lips drooped into a frown as he realized that the frog must have escaped during the night. Tommy threw on his clothes from yesterday that were strewn about the floor, and ran out the door on the hunt for his new friend. He searched the park high and low, calling out Samuel's name every so often. Tommy searched the trees, but alas there was only a hive of bees. As he was peering into the bushes, he felt something move beneath him. All of a sudden, Tommy was lifted high into the air on his belly, a massive buck beneath him. The buck was very unhappy to find Tommy perched upon his head, so he tossed him off, Tommy landing in the pond nearby with a splash. Sputtering, he sat up, pushing his wet hair out of his eyes to reassess his surroundings. It was then that he heard a croak. Tommy immediately thought of Samuel and began to search the pond's surroundings. Not a minute went by before another croak was issued from behind a large log. Tommy rounded the corner, and to his surprise not only saw Samuel, but an entire family of frogs. This must be Samuel's wife and kids, Tommy thought. He decided that Samuel would be much happier here with his family than in the jar that Tommy had for him at home. With this bittersweet knowledge, Tommy said farewell to his new friend and headed home after promising to visit him often. Even though Tommy knew he couldn't raise Samuel as his own, he was still happy to know that the frog was safe and with his family.

In fact, Timothy was holding onto a young buck! <br/> The buck did not care for Timothy's manhandling at all, and he twisted his large head, sending Timothy tumbling down a small drop into a pond. <br/> Patrick, ever a good dog, leapt after Timothy and helped him swim to safety outside the water.

That man then places the baby in the same carriage that Chaplin had originally attempted to place it in, as the mother is not present in that moment, he then walks away as well. The mother then returns to her carriage to see the extra baby in it just as Chaplin walks by. She gives the baby to him, he sits down on the curb with the baby and then realizes that there is a note.

There isn’t anyone else around so he tries to find the parent or caretaker of the child to return it. He tries to give it to a woman who has another child and a large carriage for children but she clearly isn’t the mother because she refuses to take it. Then when going to return the child back to where he found it, a police officer arrives and it looks like Charlie is abandoning the child in the street so he keeps it again. Charlie gives the child to a random man in the street, who then puts it into the carriage of the woman from earlier. She then forces Charlie to keep the baby.

Upon walking out of the alley he sees a orphaned baby wrapped up in a blanket right next to a dumpster. Chaplin looks for the baby’s parents or possible owner to no avail, so he walks back and forth in search of someone he can give the baby to. When a woman walks into the alleyway with a carriage and a baby of her own, Chaplin waits until she is not paying attention and puts the orphaned baby in the carriage—the woman notices and shoos him and the baby away. Hopeless Chaplin again tries to leave the baby in the alley but is caught red-handed by a police man. Chaplin nonchalantly walks through the streets to escape the police man, and approaches the woman with the carriage again. They get into a fight, broken up by the police officer, and Chaplin walks back to the opening of the alleyway. As he decides where he will leave the baby next, he finds a note that instructs him to take care of the orphaned baby.

He looks around, takes out a small box with cigarettes inside, and starts smoking again. Then he takes off his gloves, lights the cigarette, and finds a baby! He looks around to try to figure out where it came from, but doesn't see anything. In the meantime, a woman with a stroller walks past him in the background, and it seems likely that she is looking for the missing baby. At this point Charlie Chaplin catches sight of her, and tries to chase her down, but she disappears into one of the buildings nearby. He returns the baby, but the woman scolds him because the baby isn't actually hers. Then a policeman comes and watches Charlie Chaplin put the baby back where he found it in the alley, so Chaplin picks it up again. He then tries to hand the baby off to a random man he finds on a different street, but the man returns it. Then he tries to leave the baby in the same woman's stroller as earlier, but she chases him down with an umbrella and forces him to take back the baby.

Ferrell plays Buddy, a human who was adopted by Santa's elves after he crawled into Santa's toy bag as a baby living in an orphanage. As Buddy grows up he is never told that he is a human, however, it becomes clear that he doesn't have the skill set required to make it as an elf. Eventually his adopted elf father tells him he is a human, and has a father living in New York City. Buddy decides to go to New York to meet his long lost family. Unfortunately, he finds out that his dad is on ""the naughty list"". The rest of the movie is about Buddy reconnecting with his father and step mom and brother. He works in a department store and falls in love with another employee. He spreds Christmas cheer around the city. However, on Christmas Eve he ruins his father's business meeting. He runs away into central park. Meanwhile Santa's reindeer run on Christmas spirit, but because less and less people believe in him, there is less spirit to run the sleigh. Buddy and his elf father had installed an engine into the sleigh, but it fell out over New York City. Santa crashed into Central Park. Buddy runs into Santa and tries to help Santa fix the engine. They have to go quickly because the police are coming to find out what crashed in Central Park (it was Santa). A crowd of people including newcasters gather to watch the event, although they do not know Santa is the one who crashed. Then Buddy's dad and step brother come find Buddy so his dad can apologize. His step brother realizes the only way to get the sleigh to run is to create Christmas spirit. The brother takes Santa's book and runs to find the crowd of people who have gathered and starts to read off what each person wants for Christmas. It increases the Christmas spirit a little bit. Then he starts singing Christmas carols and eventually basically all of New York is singing Christmas carols. Santa's reindeer gets enough energy to fly and Santa can continue delivering presents. Buddy marries the girl he fell in love with and they have a baby and everyone lives happily ever after."

It is about a small boy who is home sick from school, and his grandfather comes to visit him and read a book to him. The book the grandfather reads is called The Princess Bride, and that is about a young woman who loves a man who seems to die, so she promises herself to a cruel prince. Shortly before her wedding, however, she is kidnapped by a Spaniard, a giant, and Wallace Shawn. A pirate comes to rescue her, defeating each man in turn. It is soon revealed that the pirate is the princess bride's long-lost love, and they try to escape together through a swamp. They survive the swamp and find the princess's fiance waiting for them at the end of it. To stop a fight, the princess promises she will return to the prince in exchange for her love's life. However, instead of letting her love go, the prince locks him up and tortures him to near death. The giant and the Spaniard have a heartwarming change of alliances and help the princess's love, saving his life and storming the castle to stop the princess's wedding. They escape into the sunset together in an appropriately cliched ending. The child and the grandfather end the movie with a heartwarming moment of renewed closeness and a better relationship together, proving that there is more love in the world than romantic.

Soon, the king throws a ball with the aim of finding a wife for his son. Cinderella faces various challenges set by her stepmother and stepsister in getting to the ball, but arrives and steals the prince's attention from the stepsister who herself had desired to marry the prince.

Pete quickly got dressed and him and Albus followed the trail back to park were they had found Clementi. They looked for him everywhere. As Albus howled across the wildflower fields, Pete shouted  ""Clemeti, Clementi where are you, you toad?"", but the only ones that replied where the noisy black sparrows that flew off slightly annoyed.  <br/> Clementi wasn't in a hole in a tree either, and he wasn't near the beehive that clumsy Albus knocked down... Pete was about  to give up, when he decided to climb a big rock to see if he could spot him from up high. He repeated his howl, ""Clemeti, Clementi where are you, you  frog?"". Suddenly a deer leaped from behind the rocks and pushed Pete and poor Albus of a cliff. They both fell and  plunged to a shallow pond. Albus dragged drowsy Pete so he could latch on to a floating hollow log,  which was quite unnecessary since the pond was barely five inches deep. Pete regained consciousness thanks to the slobberness of Albus's incessant lick. Slowly, a blurry image became clear, and Pete now took notice on what he had in front of him. A big Papa frog, next to it a smaller Mama frog and half a dozen baby frogs, all staring at him with their big squishy eyes. Pete realized Papa frog was his lost friend Clementi, except he was no longer lost. He had returned home to the empty log where he and his family lived. Pete felt sad to leave his friend behind, but knew he was much needed at home with his family. Albus and Pete set themselves off their way back home, as Clementi began to sing. Joined by the rest of his family, they choired a tune goodbye.  <br/>  <br/> The End."

He went and searched the forest, but he also couldn’t find the frog there. To get better ground, he stood on top of a rock to shout for the frog. When he shouted the first time, a mean and evil deer scooped the boy up and threw him into a river, knocking the boy out. Upon waking up, the boy gathered his surroundings and propped himself up on a log. Looking around, he noticed some new animals he has never seen before, like a squirrel.

People throw things at him out of windows, but he keeps smoking and strutting down the street mostly unbothered. He stumbles upon a baby in the alley and thinks it belongs to a lady with a stroller passing by. He says “I think you dropped something” and puts the baby in the stroller, but she refuses to take it and indicates the baby is not hers. He tries to put the baby back and a policeman sees him so he picks the baby up again. Then he asks a man with a cane to hold the baby while he ties his shoe and runs away. The man puts the baby in the woman's stroller and walks away. The woman comes out of the store and sees Charlie Chaplin walking by, sees the baby, and beats Carlie with her umbrella and forces him to take the child away. Charlie Chaplin sits on the curb with the baby and briefly considers throwing the baby in the gutter, but decides not to. He finds a piece of paper tucked into the baby’s blanket that says “please love and care for this orphan child”

He continues to walk through the gulley before something else is thrown next to him, again from above. He gets his baccy tin out which is full of cigar butts. He takes out a rollie from the tin and puts it in his mouth. He then gets a match and lights it on the sole of his shoe and uses the match to light his fag. He stars smoking then sees a baby, which he approaches before picking it up. He sees a woman has walked past with a pram so he puts the baby in it and tells her she must've lost something. The pair have an argument before Chaplain ends up having to take the baby back. He goes back to the same place in the gulley that he found the baby and starts to put it back down on the floor whilst a police man comes up behind him. Chaplain sees the police man and ends up having to pick the baby back up. So, he goes round the corner to loose the police man. On the road he pretends to step in some mud and asks an old man with a beard if he'll hold onto the baby for a sec before running away. The old man puts the baby in the same pram as Chaplain had already. The woman gets furious at Chaplain and runs after him with her brolly hitting him constantly til he takes the baby away again. Eventually Chaplain sits down on the curb and opens the grate thinking about throwing the baby down the drain. In the end, he decided that he isn't that mean and instead reaches into the baby's clothes to see that his mother had left a note asking for someone to look after the poor orphan.

However a policeman appears and notices what he is doing, and Charlie immediately picks the baby back up and heads off. He then happens upon an elderly man who he dupes into taking the baby by pretending to tie his shoelaces before running off. The elderly man, after failing to catch up with Charlie, then also finds the pram and puts the baby in it before walking off. Charlie walks down the street carefree past the pram only to be seen by the mother who angrily chases him down the street and hits him with an umbrella, thinking he has attempted to once again pass the burden of the baby onto her. The policeman gets involved so Charlie, defeated, takes the baby once more and sits on the street curb by a drain. He momentarily considers putting the baby in the drain and leaving however discovers a note in the baby's clothes begging for its finder to look after it, for it is an orphan. Taken aback, Charlie decides to keep the baby and walks off with it off camera, with uplifting music beginning to play in the background.

Unfortunately (for Chaplin), the mother resists and Chaplin returns to the original spot where he found the baby to leave the baby there. While attempting to get rid of the child a cop walks into the scene and Chaplin is forced to pretend he did not just attempt to abandon this child. Next he takes the baby to a main street where he passes the baby off to a stranger while pretending that he needs to tie his shoes, but turns to sprint away instead.

Film	written_online	10	""	A film that I have recently watched is The Dark Knight, which is an action/thriller between Batman and the joker. The plot of the movie is essentially a never ending struggle between Batman and the joker for control over the city of Gotham. There is an attorney named Harvey Dent who is referred to in the movie as Gotham's shining light against crime and corruption. Unfortunately, the joker kills Harvey's loving girlfriend Rachel which begins to sow the seeds of Harvey's demise. After he loses his woman his face is badly burned, and in his hospital bed he realizes he can no longer save Gotham city so he becomes evil. Batman tries with all his strength to combat the joker and save the city, but he would have never suspected the once loved district attorney (Mr. Dent) would eventually become the malevolent villain 2-face. The ending of the movie is very bittersweet, because Batman never truly gets the recognition he deserves. He kills the joker and saves the city from seemingly never ending chaos, however his public image is forever tarnished because he gets blamed for the murder of Lieutenant Gordon (who is actually killed by the now evil character 2-face). The Dark Knight is an absolutely fantastic film with a tragic ending, but it sheds light on the fact that some men (the joker, particularly) don't seek anything rational, they merely want to see the world burn. It is the responsibility of good citizens (such as Batman) to stand up in the face of this wickedness and combat it, even if it means losing everything else in the process.

Carefully scooping the frog up, he popped him in the pocket of his coat and treaded home, Chewbaca leading the way. Tommy named the frog Freddie and cared for him well, ensuring that Freddie was well fed. Tommy tucked Freddie up in a glass bowl for the night, himself climbing into his bed where Chewbaca settled at his feet.  <br/> As the moon rose, Tommy and Chewbaca slept soundly, breathing deeply. However, Freddie had other ideas. Stretching his legs gently, he climbed up and out of the glass bowl that had served as his bed and gingerly crept out of Tommy's room, down the corridor, down the stairs and out of the door.  <br/> On awakening, Tommy and Chewbaca realised with a jolt that Freddie's glass bowl was empty. Throwing on his coat and wellies, Tommy charged out of the house, with Chewbaca hot on his heels. Tommy was worried that Freddie would get lost, or even worse, eaten! Tommy shouted; Chewbaca howled. Tommy climbed up into a tree for a better view; Chewbaca scrabbled. They climbed, they crawled, they trip-trapped over streams, and they got into all sorts of scrapes! Tommy and Chewbaca were causing so much of a racket in the quiet wood that other animals came out to see what the fuss was about. One particularly disgruntled elk even barged Tommy off a rock and Tommy landed splash into the stream! Fortunately, Tommy wasn't hurt and was guarded from further harm by Chewbaca. Then, over the trickle of the stream and the gentle rustling of the wind, Tommy and Chewbaca heard a croak. And then another croak. And another. Tommy and Chewbaca poked their heads over the log next to the stream and to their surprise saw not only Freddie but his family! Tommy and Chewbaca were delighted to find Freddie and to see that he was reunited with his loved ones. Tommy and Chewbaca hugged Freddie and waved goodbye, happy to head on to their next adventure.

Charlie was entranced, and couldn't wait to get the frog home to show his friends.  <br/> When he got home, and the frog sat in the jam jar staring at him, Charlie felt put out. Its magic had dissipated- now that its surroundings were normal, the frog looked out of place, and far from home. Its skin was too green, too speckled, it glistened too much for the dry ordinariness of Charlie's bedroom.  <br/> When Charlie woke up the next morning, he was shocked to find the frog was gone. For a second he was relieved, thinking it must have found its way back to its forest home. Then he looked in fear at his dog, and realised with a gulp how big Spot must look to the poor little frog.  <br/> Charlie looked high and low, but he couldn't find the frog anywhere. He looked under the stairs, in his garden, up a tree, behind a rock- everywhere! All the while he was calling to the frog, 'I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry Frog!', desperately hoping for a conciliatory 'ribbit' in reply. There was only silence.

Charlie has to take his newfound orphan and try and give it to someone else. He walks down an alleyway and passes the baby to an old man with a walking stick. Charlies character pretends to do his laces and then runs away and hides. The old man then places the baby, after some time, back into the pram we saw from earlier.

He was certainly bothered by the trash thrown at him. But, even more, he didn't know what to do with the baby. In a humorous and lighthearted clip Chaplin searched for an inconspicuous place to leave the baby and even attempted to place it in another baby's stroller. Near the end of the clip Chaplin bounces between two extremes, throwing the baby down the sewer and actually feeling sympathy for the child. This change of heart came after Chaplin found a letter in the baby's blanket asking for him to care for the orphan child. In the end, Chaplin appeared to have a ""normal"" human reaction and accept responsibility to care for the baby at least temporarily."

Then he stops, takes a cigarette out of a box from his inside coat pocket, takes off his gloves, strikes a match on the heel of his shoe, and lights the cigarette. He throws his gloves into the trash can beside him. Then he notices a baby wrapped in a blanket lying on the ground against the brick wall of the alley he's in. He glances closer at the baby, looks up around him as if to see whether anyone at a window nearby might be looking for a baby, and finally picks up the baby, just as a woman with a perambulator comes into the alley. He spots her and tries to hail her, but she parks the perambulator and slips away somewhere between a staircase and a wall. The man carries the baby toward the perambulator and puts the baby into it just as the woman comes back. He thinks he's returned the baby to where it came from, but the woman shouts at him, indicating that he's wrong. There's already another infant in the perambulator. The man takes the baby out again and hurries away with it. He makes to put the baby back where he found it, but then he realizes a policeman is watching him, so he picks the baby back up and walks off. He goes around the corner, sees a man walking down the street, and puts the baby in his arms. He pretends to tie his shoelace, as if that was why he needed someone to hold the baby, but then he bolts, leaving the second man with the baby. The second man walks off in a hurry, sees the same perambulator as before left outside an open doorway, and deposits the baby in it. Meanwhile, the first man has hidden in a building back in the alley. When he comes out, he comes face to face with the policeman again and hurries off. Meanwhile, the woman has emerged from the shop and finds the second baby in her perambulator again. Just then, the first man walks by, and she, believing he's put the baby in her perambulator again, chases after him, knocks him down by hitting him on the head with her umbrella, and then beats him about the head with the umbrella, dragging him back to the perambulator. She points at the baby, insisting he take it back. The policeman arrives to see what the commotion is all about, and the man, not wanting to get in trouble, takes the baby and goes off again. He drops his cane in the gutter and sits down on the curb to retrieve it. He remains seated, though, lifts the grate of the storm sewer, and considers throwing the baby in for a moment before closing the grate. Then he sticks his hand into the blanket the baby is wrapped in and finds a note that reads, ""Please love and care for this orphan child."" He seems to feel a sudden tenderness for the baby. He smiles at it and then stands up and walks off with the baby in his arms."

He then removed a tin from his pocket, and removed a cigar from it, took off his gloves, lit the cigar, and looked to his left where he saw a crying baby.  He searched for the baby's parents, and brought it to a random woman with a baby carriage.  She angrily told him the baby wasn't hers, and forced him to remove it.  Chaplin proceeded to try and abandon the baby, but was was forced to keep it because a police officer threatened to arrest him.  He then left the baby with a homeless man, who abandoned the baby with the woman with the carriage again.  The woman with the carriage assumed that Chaplin had abandoned the baby again, and complained to a police officer about Chaplin's actions.  Chaplin, fearing potential of legal recourse, sat on a street corner pondering what to do with the child.  He discovered a message in the blanket the child was wrapped in asking that someone care for the orphaned child.  Chaplin then stood up and walked away, taking the child with him."

A few feet further, he saw a baby laying on the ground, wrapped up, by himself. He picked the baby up and looked for the caretaker, but no one was around. Then, a mother with a carriage, already carrying one baby, passed by, so he immediately assumed it must be hers and dropped the abandoned baby in the carriage. She freaked out, and took the baby out. He tried to give the baby up a few more times, but in the end, he decided to keep it and care for it as he found a note saying to do so for the orphan child.

As the boy slept Tucker climbed out of the fish bowl and made a daring escape. The next morning when the boy awoke he realized Tucker had run away. The boy was upset but his mother told him to go looking for his frog. He called out to it across his back yard ""Tucker!!, where are ya, boy!?"" He looked in a hollow tree and checked behind a rock. Then a bush from behind the rock began to move. There was a thunderous noise and the boy realized that the bushes were really the antlers of a stag! The boy cried out as the stag’s antler caught his clothing and dragged him across the meadow to an edge of a cliff. Suddenly the boy was falling and he thought he might die. Luckily, he splashed into the water of the creek.  <br/> The boy was able to swim to the edge of a creek bed but his clothes were soaked. He gathered himself and continued to look for Tucker. Suddenly he heard a ""Ribbit"" Then two more. He looked down and realized Tucker was sitting under a log watching him. Right next to him was a lady frog and many little frog babies. Tucker was a Father! The boy was sad to leave but he knew that Tucker had a family just like the boy. He remembered then that he was late for dinner. He waved goodbye to Tucker and hurried to get back home, he hoped supper would be waiting. It had been a long day."

He stayed up late watching Frog in his jar house.  “Tomorrow I will get you an even bigger house, Frog,” Timmy promised.  “But now I have to go to bed.” <br/> But that night, when everyone was asleep, something unexpected happened! <br/> When Timmy awoke, he peered over the side of the bed to see Frog.  Frog was gone!  His jar house was empty.  Timmy gazed at the empty jar house with disappointment and sadness.  “I miss Frog already!  I will go find him,” Timmy declared. <br/> Timmy quickly changed out of his pajamas and ran outside.  Timmy called out for Frog.  “Frog, where are you?  Frog, it’s Timmy!  Frog, I’m here to get you!”  But Timmy did not hear Frog.  Not even one croak could be heard in the meadow. <br/> Timmy looked further, entering the forest.  Could Frog be in a tree?  Timmy searched and searched, high and low, in every place he could think of. <br/> “Frog, it’s Timmy!  Where are you?”  Timmy climbed up a big rock to help him see deeper into the forest. <br/> Just then, the sticks Timmy was holding onto started to move!  Timmy fell into the sticks and was lifted into the air!  The sticks weren’t sticks, they were the antlers of a deer! <br/> The deer carried Timmy away from the rock and to the edge of a cliff.  Timmy was afraid of what would happen next.  And then suddenly the deer flung his head forward, and Timmy was launched over the cliff.  “Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!” Timmy cried as he fell through the air. <br/> Splash!!  Timmy landed in a pond of water. <br/> “Well, that wasn’t so bad,” Timmy said as he climbed out of the pond.  He was tired from calling and searching and climbing and falling and wading.  Timmy laid over a big log on the edge of the pond to rest. <br/> To his surprise, on the other side of the log was Frog!  Timmy was not tired any more, he was excited!  “Frog!” Timmy exclaimed.  “Frog, I found you!  Who are these with you?”  Timmy saw so many frogs.  “Frog, is this your family?”  Timmy realized why Frog had left in the middle of the night.  Frog had a frog family, with baby frogs and a wife frog.  Frog missed his frog family, so he went back to them in the forest.  “Oh Frog, you missed your frog family.  Your frog babies need you here in the forest by the pond.  You need to stay here to live with them.  But I will miss you, too.”  Timmy looked sad, but then he noticed that one of Frog’s frog babies had hopped over to him and was sitting right next to Timmy’s hand.  “I wish you could come home with me instead, Frog Baby,” Timmy said as a tear fell down his cheek.  The frog baby hopped onto Timmy’s lap.  “Do you want to come with me?” Timmy asked.  “Won’t your family miss you?”  Timmy looked at Frog.  Frog’s big throat puffed out in a bubble.  As if to show that Frog Baby should go with Timmy, Frog croaked with a big, loud, deep CROAK!! <br/> Timmy jumped up and picked up Frog Baby.  “Thank you, Frog!” Timmy said as he happily picked up Frog Baby.  “I will take good, good care of Frog Baby and visit you in this forest all the time,” Timmy said.  “Frog Baby can live in the jar house, which is big for him because he is so little.  Thank you, Frog!  Thank you, frog family!”  Timmy cuddled Frog Baby near his cheek and kissed Frog Baby on the head.  “We can go home together,” he said.  Timmy turned towards home with Frog Baby in his hand.  As he waded back across the pond, he turned to wave to Frog and his frog family one more time.  They all sat on the log and croaked to say good-bye.  “Goodbye, frog family!” called Timmy.  And together Timmy and Frog Baby set off for home for a few adventure together.  The end.

Chaplin is shocked that someone would throw a baby out a window like the other trash, and looks up and around for the source. Fortunately, moments later a woman with a carriage happens by. He runs after her, telling her she's dropped something. She denies it and Charlie tries to put the baby in her carriage regardless. She argues until he agrees to take the baby away again -- first nearly making off with the woman's baby! -- and brings it back where he found it.  <br/>  <br/> Just as he is laying the baby back among the trashcans, a police officer happens along, and, believing Charlie Chaplin to be the original abandoner of the baby, scolds him and apparently threatens him in such a ways as to convince him to pick the child back up again.  <br/>  <br/> Around the corner, Chaplin encounters an old man with a cane. He hands the baby to the man, indicating a need to tie his shoe, and as soon as the man has the baby, Charlie Chaplin runs off again, apparently free at last. However, it is not to be. The old man finds the same woman with her carriage, and, as her back is turned, tries the same trick, leaving the child behind in her carriage just as Charlie reappears on the scene. Naturally the woman believes him to have placed the baby in her carriage, and he is forced by the returning police officer to pick it up yet again. <br/>  <br/> Discouraged, and having dropped his cane in a gutter, Chaplin sits down on the curb. He briefly considers dropping the child down into the sewer, but this prospect is too cruel. Instead, he discovers among the blankets a note which reads ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". As the music turns sentimental, Charlie's heart is changed, and he tenderly carries the child with him and out of sight."

Unfortunately, just seconds later the old woman returns, sees what Charlie has done and harshly reproaches him. <br/>  <br/> There are a couple more instances where Charlie tries to get rid of the baby but is thwarted again and again by the old woman, another street person, and also by a police officer walking his beat. Eventually, tired of trying, Charlie is sitting on a curb next to a sewer grate. For a moment he considers tossing the baby down the hole but thankfully reconsiders. At that point, he finds a note in the baby's breast pocket which states, ""Please love and care for this poor orphan child"".  <br/>  <br/> In this final scene, we see Charlie's demeanor flipflop as he develops an on-the-spot paternal instinct, and as the clip draws to an end it becomes clear that the baby has found a home."

After that he lit up a cigarette and then he saw a baby left lying on the ground, wrapped up in a blanket. He then picked up the baby, trying to figure out what to do with it when he turned around to see a policeman standing there, watching him, to see what he would do (he was going to set the baby on the ground and leave, but picked it up again). The policeman moved on and a woman walked by, pushing a baby carriage with her own child inside. He tried to put the baby in there too, but the woman yelled at him so he took it out and held it again, trying to think what he should do with it. So then, as he was walking in town, he saw a older gentleman walking with a cane, to whom he gave the child. When the older man realized what Charlie had given him, he freaked out, not wanting to be responsible for a baby. Next, the older man saw the same baby carriage from before, which was in front of a store, where the woman was. So the older man put the baby in the baby carriage and took off quickly. When the woman came out of the store and saw the baby she got mad, which was just when Charlie was walking by. She was yelling at Charlie to take the baby just when the same policeman came by, so Charlie again picked up the baby and walked elsewhere. Last, he sat down on the sidewalk trying to think of his next move and even contemplating putting the baby in the grate (where water flows) in the street, when he noticed a paper stuck in the baby's clothing, which said something about ""please love and take care of this orphan child."" When he read that he smiled and held the baby close to his heart."

At one point he shouts up to complain and is called an """"awkward ass"". He stops to take out of his pocket a tin of cigar and cigarette butts. We see him search through the selection before he picks one to smoke. He lights a loose match on the sole of his shoe. The tramp has torn and weatherbeaten clothing. We see him throw his gloves, which are full of holes, into the nearest bin. Beside a bin, on the floor, he finds a baby bundled up in blankets. He picks up the baby and tries to give it to a passing woman who is pushing a big pram with a different baby inside. The tramp thinks that she has dropped the baby. She is indignant and insists that he takes the baby away. The tramp goes back to the bins where he found the baby and tries to leave it there. A passing policeman catches him in the act, so Chaplin quickly takes the baby and moves on. He tries another trick to get rid of it by asking a passing man to hold it while he ties his shoelace. He runs away  but the man puts the baby in the same pram  we saw previously. So when Chaplin passes it the woman recognises him and chases him, beating him with an umbrella. The same police officer insists the tramp take the baby and so he does. We see him sit with the bundle near a draincover where he seems to briefly consider putting the baby in the sewer. Inside the blankets the tramp finds a note asking someone to please love the orphan child. This seems to warm his heart and the tramp seems to be happy to accept his task of loving and caring for the baby. He smiles for the first time and hugs the child close to him. We seem him walk away from the camera holding  his new charge."

Lo and behold! As he stops to light a cigarette, he spots a swaddled baby lying on the ground next to the garbage can!  What could it be doing there?! He is confused and conflicted about what to do, at first looking up to the surrounding windows to see if someone had ""thrown"" the baby out of them (a very funny moment).  But that's a ridiculous thought, so he then picks up the baby and start walking around.  When he spots a woman with a baby carriage, he tries to surreptitiously place the baby in the carriage, but she comes out and starts yelling at him.  He reluctantly picks up the baby and returns to the alley where he found it.  But when he tries to abandon it there, a cop strolls by and, stricken by guilt--or fear of punishment--he picks up the baby and walks off.  He comes upon another fellow and, pretending that he needs to tie his shoe, he foists the baby off onto the stranger and runs away.  The stranger just ""happens"" to dump the baby in the same carriage of the grumpy woman from earlier and then leaves.  Chaplin just ""happens"" to be walking by her when she comes out and discovers the baby in her carriage.  She, of course, recognizes Chaplin from earlier and runs after him, whacking him with her umbrella.  In haste, Chaplin grabs the child and returns to the place of origin.  There he sits on the curb,  glances down at the sewer grate, lifts it up, and for a second considers dumping the child down it.  But!  Good news!  He finds a note pinned to the baby saying that he is an orphan and that the mother is asking for whoever finds him to love him and take care of him.  Chaplin's demeanor changes completely!  He smiles and lovingly cradles the baby as he walks off."

Film	written_online	10	""	Just last night the movie 'Independence Day' was on TV, so I watched most of it. In the movie, aliens come to Earth to exterminate all life there and take over the planet. They plan on then exploiting all of the planet's natural resources and then move on to the next available planet. When their space ships first arrive and assume their positions over various locations, world leaders are unsure about how to react. They actually wait until the aliens attack, destroying many major cities around the world, before they do something. The movies centers mainly around two heroes, a fighter pilot played by Will Smith and a geeky data nerd played by Jeff Goldblum. They end up saving the world, of course. The movie is called 'Independence Day' because the final dramatic battle takes place on the fourth of July, America's independence day. In the closing scenes of the film, the American president holds an emotional rallying speech, where he proclaims that that July 4th will henceforth be known as Independence Day for the entire world, not just the USA. The genre of the movie is adventure, although there is also a great deal of humor it in so it might also be called a comedy -- if one overlooks the millions and millions of people who are killed.
